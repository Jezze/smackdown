# Smackdown #

Smackdown is a very simple text to html converter. It is based on ideas from Markdown written by John Gruber and shares simular syntax.

The big differences compared to Markdown is that Smackdown:

* Has an interpreter implmenetation of 2k compared to 45k
* It handles all double newlines as paragraphs
* It handles all single newlines as breaks and does not require spaces
* It replaces some of Markdown's builtin URL and IMG syntax with something called replacement tags.

## Syntax ##

### Headers ###

# This is a H1 #
## This is a H2 ##

### Bold/Italics ###

*This is bold*
_This is underline_

### Paragraphs ###

This is one paragraph.

This is the second.

### Breaks ###

This is first row.
This is second row.

### Tags ###

Tags work by defining a row of text that will be replaced by a predefined type of object.

^this is a replacement tag:1^

^this is another replacement tag:2^

[1:url:http://replacemnet.url/]
[2:image:http://replacemnet/image.png]

The first tag will be replaced by a link and the second by an image.

## Usage ##

It is very simple to use smackdown. Here is an example:

<?

require_once('smackdown.php');

$output = Smackdown::parse($input);

?>

Where $input is the string you wish to convert and $output is the resulting string.
